# Event Hooks

Sometimes you'll want to always run some code before or after a handler function.

API Star provides something very similar to middleware, that lets you register
a group of functions to be run in response to particular events.

Here's an example...

```python
class CustomHeadersHook:
    def on_response(self, response: http.Response):
        response.headers['x-custom'] = 'Ran on_response()'

event_hooks = [CustomHeadersHook]

app = App(routes=routes, event_hooks=event_hooks)
```

An event hook instance may include any or all of the following methods:

* `on_request(self, ...)` - Runs before the handler function.
* `on_response(self, ...)` - Runs after the handler function, or when a handled exception occurs.
* `on_error(self, ...)` - Runs after any unhandled exception occurs.

The signature of the method may include any annotations that would be available
on a handler function, or the `http.Response` annotation.

## Error handling

Subclasses of `HTTPException` are dealt with by the applications exception handler,
and return responses, that pass through any `on_response` hooks as usual.

Unhandled exceptions result in server errors, and should be treated differently.
For these cases, any installed `on_error` event hooks will be run. This event hook
allows you to monitor or log exceptions.

It's recommend that use of `on_error` event hooks should be kept to a minimum,
dealing only with whatever error monitoring is required.

## Using event hooks

Event hooks can pull in components such as the request, the returned response,
or the exception that resulted in a response. For example:

```python
class ErrorHandlingHook:
    def on_response(self, response: http.Response, exc: Exception):
        if exc is None:
            print("Handler returned a response")
        else:
            print("Exception handler returned a response")

    def on_error(self, response: http.Response):
        print("An unhandled error was raised")


app = App(routes=routes, event_hooks=[ErrorHandlingHook])
```

Event hooks are instantiated at the start of every request/response cycle, and can
store state between the request and response events.

```python
class TimingHook:
    def on_request(self):
        self.started = time.time()

    def on_response(self):
        duration = time.time() - self.started
        print("Response returned in %0.6f seconds." % duration)


app = App(routes=routes, event_hooks=[TimingHook])
```

## Ordering of event hooks

The `on_request` hooks are run in the order that their classes are included.

The `on_response` and `on_error` hooks are run in the reverse order that their classes are included.

This behaviour ensures that event hooks run in a similar manner to stack-based middleware,
with the each event hook wrapping everything that comes after it.
